Picobot
=======

This is a small Picobot simulator.  https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/[Picobot] is
a simple state machine exercise developed by Harvey Mudd College as part of
their https://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/index.html[CS for All] book.

The goal of this simulator is to provide a way to test rulesets and write
regression tests against these rulesets, so that improvements and optimizations
don't break functionality.
